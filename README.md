# odin-recipes
I will be making my first website in odin project. It will be a basic HTML only website. We will later fix it up with CSS.

AAR:
First step using github was really confusing. After this i understand better. Make sure you click on the .readme when you create the repo in github. This broke my brain not doing this.
