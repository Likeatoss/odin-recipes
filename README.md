# odin-recipes
I will be making my first website in odin project. It will be a basic HTML only website. We will later fix it up with CSS.

AAR:
First step using github was really confusing. After this i understand better. Make sure you click on the .readme when you create the repo in github. This broke my brain not doing this.
The code was simple it reminded me going through webdesign in high school back in 2010. HTML hasnt changed a lot from then, atleast so far. I'm looking forward to coming back to this webpage and styling it.
